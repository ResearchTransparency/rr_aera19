# Reproducible Research and
# Literate Programming

<br>

### 8:10 - 8:30


---
# A couple caveats 
* Much of what I'm going to be discussing represents an ideal that I have only recently begun working towards.

--

* None of what I will talk about should be taken as a referendum on you or
  your current practices. However, I hope to convince you that you should be working toward the reproducible research ideal, and that, as a field, we should be moving toward reproducible research being the *minimal standard*.


--
* I will be focusing on reproducible research with R (obviously). Other
  options are available but, in my view, none are as clear, comprehensive, and easy to implement as the tools at your disposal through R.

---
# What is reproducible research?
* .bolder[Replicability] is the gold standard for research. Ideally, most
research would be verified through replication. 


--
* Reproducibility represents a .bolder[minimal] standard, which itself can aid replication (tremendously), by conducting and documenting the research sufficiently that .blue[an independent researcher could reproduce all the results from a study], provided the data were available


--
* Turns out this is a more difficult standard than we would generally like to admit.

---
# Why should we care?
* Reproducibility as an ethical standard

  + More transparency
  + More potential for results to be verified (and errors found/corrected)


--
* If your work **is not** reproducible, it is often not truly replicable.


--
* If your work **is** reproducible, then others have a "recipe" for replication


---
# Are journal articles research? 
* Initially, we may think of journal articles as research, but really the
  research is everything that went into the article, not the article itself. 


--
* Some (Buckheit & Donoho, 2015) conceive of the article as the
  "advertisement".

--
* If all we have is the advertisement, can we really fully understand the
  steps and decisions made during the research?
    + In large-scale data analysis, the answer is generally "no".  

---
# Tangential benefits
Striving toward reproducible research will:
* Make your own code more efficient/easily interpretable

  + Can help with collaboration on a project

* Reduce errors

* Increase efficiency by not having to redo tables and figures with each tweak
  to a model.

---
# What does literate programming look like?
### What this workshop is about!

--
1. Start with a basic text document (not Word, text)


--
2. Use the text document to write your article


--
3. Embed code within the text document that corresponds to your analysis. Note
  this is not just copying the code in. The code should be live and what you're working with while conducting your research.


--
4. Render the document into a different format (pdf, html, etc.).
  + Select which code (if any) will be displayed
  + Build tables of results and plots to be produced


---
# End result
* Readers can then read the "advertisement", but if they are interested 
  in reproducing your results they can access the text file that contains the analysis code.

* Single product that has the advertisement and the research process embedded.

---
# Other reasons dynamic documents are useful
Outside of reproducibility, you may want to use R Markdown to:
* Produce slides

* Keep track of your analysis (notes, essentially), even if you end up using 
  something like Word

* Share code with others

* Quickly share results with others

* Produce professional looking data products


---
# Challenges
* Word is the industry standard (frustratingly so, to me) 
  + Word output is less than ideal
* Can be difficult when collaborating with others
* Some journal articles *require* papers submitted in Word
  + Potentially get a pdf to word converter, but still less than ideal
* Advanced features have a relatively steep learning curve

# Create new R Markdown doc

### Demo


---
# YAML Front Matter

```
---
title: Example Markdown document
author: 
  - Daniel Anderson
  - Joshua M. Rosen
date: "2019-05-07"
---
```

![](img/frontMatter.png)

* Three dashes before and after the YAML fields
* Case sensitive
* Many other fields are possible.
  + For example, you may want to include an `output:` argument (`pdf_document`,
    `html_document`, `word_document`). Must be specified as it is rendered, if
    not supplied.


---
# Example: Change syntax highlighting
The YAML will control a lot of how a document looks. For example, if you wanted to render with a different syntax highlighter:

.pull-left[
### Standard Rmd

```
---
title: "Doc Title"
output: pdf_document
---
```
]


.pull-right[
### kate 

```
---
title: "Doc Title"
output: 
  pdf_document:
    highlight: kate
---
```
]


---
# Code chunks versus text

![](img/code_chunks.png)

---
# Code chunks

Start a code chunk with ` ```{r}`, then produce some r code, then close the

  chunk with three additional back ticks ` ``` `.

![](img/codeChunk1.png)

--

```{r add}
a <- 3
b <- 5

a + b * (exp(a)/b)
```

# Headings and Lists 
### Not R-lists

### Level 3 (etc.)
```

<br/>

```

# echo and eval

.pull-left[

You can show code without evaluating it, using `eval = FALSE`. 

<div align = "left">
<img src = img/codeChunk2.png height = 100>
</div>


```{r rCalc2, eval = FALSE}
a + b * (exp(a)/b)
```
]

.pull-right[

Alternatively, you can evaluate the code without displaying it, using `echo = 
  FALSE`.

<div align = "left">
<img src = img/codeChunk3.png height = 100>
</div>

```{r plotExample, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 11}
data(mtcars)
with(mtcars, plot(mpg, hp, 
  xlab = "Miles Per Gallon", 
  ylab = "Horsepower",
  main = "Relation between Miles Per Gallon and Horsepower"))
```

]

---
# warning

```{r loadggplot, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 25))
```

### Warning = `FALSE`
```{r ggplotWarning2, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(msleep, aes(sleep_rem, sleep_total)) + 
  geom_point()
```
Warning is printed to the console when rendering.


---

### Warning = `TRUE`
```{r ggplotWarning1, fig.height = 6, warning = TRUE}
ggplot(msleep, aes(sleep_rem, sleep_total)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---
# Show errors

`error = TRUE`
```{r showErrors, fig.show = "hide", error = TRUE}
ggplot(msleep, aes(sleep, sleep_total)) + 
  geom_point()
```

--

<br>

If `error = FALSE`, the document won't render if it encounters an error.

![](img/errorRendering.png)

---
# Message
Some functions will return messages. You may want to suppress these.

### message = `FALSE`
```{r messages2, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(msleep, aes(sleep_total)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

---
# Message

### message = `TRUE`
```{r messages1, fig.height = 5, message = TRUE}
ggplot(msleep, aes(sleep_total)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

---
# include

![](img/includeFALSE.png)

The `include` argument is used to evaluate code that is not included in the
document at all. For example, when setting up your global options.


---
# Setting global options
Change the default behavior

```{r globalOps1, eval = FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(...) # insert options here
```

For example, you can set `echo = FALSE` and `fig.width = 6.5` and `fig.height = 8` with the following code.

```{r globalOps2, eval = FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 8)
```

This is most useful when producing a report for somebody who doesn't use R and has no use or knowledge of the code.


You can always override the global options within a particular chunk, e.g.

` ```{r, chunkName, echo = TRUE}` 

` ``` `

---
## Other things to consider setting globally:
* `warnings = FALSE`
* `message = FALSE`
* `errors = TRUE`
* `echo = FALSE`
* Caching options (next slides)


---
# More complete chunk options

```{r chunkOptions1, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", message = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
ops <- c("eval", "echo", "results", "warning", "error", "message", "include", 
            "tidy", "cache", "cache.comments", "dependson", "autodep", "fig.height/fig.width", "fig.show", "interval")
args <- c("logical", "logical", "markup, asis, hold, hide", 
            "logical", "logical", "logical", "logical", "logical", 
            "logical, 0:3", "logical", 
            "char, num", "logical", "numeric",
            "asis, hold, animate, hide", "numeric")
default <- c("TRUE", "TRUE", "markup", "TRUE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "TRUE",
              "FALSE", "FALSE", "NULL", "NULL", "FALSE", "7, 7", "asis", "1")
result <- c("Evaluate the code?", "Show the code?", "Render the results",
              "Print warnings?", "Preserve errors? (if FALSE, quit)", 
              "Print any messages?",
              "Include any of the code or output or code?", 
              "Tidy code? (see formatR package)", "Cache code chunks?",
              "Cache invalidated by comment changes?",
              "Current chunk depend on prior cached chunks?",
              "Depends determined automatically? ",
              "Height and width of figure", 
              "How the figure should be displayed", 
              "Animate speed")
kable(data.frame(ops, args, default, result)[1:8, ], 
      col.names = c("Options", "Arguments", "Default", "Result"),
      format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

---
# (and a few more)

```{r chunkOptions2, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", message = FALSE}
knitr::kable(data.frame(ops, args, default, result)[9:15, ], 
  col.names = c("Options", "Arguments", "Default", "Result"))
```

---
# Inline code

A single back tick followed by `r` produces inline code to be evaluated.

<div align = "center">
<img src = img/inlineCode.png width = 1000>
</div>
<br>

This is an example of inline code, where I want to refer to the sum of `a` and
  `b`, which is `r a + b`.

This is *extremely* useful in writing reports. Never have to update any numbers in text, regardless of changes to your models or data (if you are careful about it).

# Final Product

<div >
<img src = img/rMarkdownCode.png height = 500>
</div>

.pull-right[
<div >
<img src = img/fullRMarkdownDoc.png height = 500>

# Overview
* New package (still very actively under development) by RStudio

* Really promising
  + Pipe-oriented
  + Beautiful tables easy
  + Spanner heads/grouping used to be a total pain - not so anymore
  + Renders to HTML/PDF without even thinking about it

* May run into bumps because of the active development

---
# Install

```{r install-gt, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")
```

---
# The hard part
* Getting your data in the format you want a table in

* Utilize your `gather`/`spread` skills regularly

```{r flying}
library(fivethirtyeight)
flying
```

---
```{r flying2}
smry <- flying %>% 
  count(gender, age, recline_frequency) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(age),
         !is.na(recline_frequency)) %>% 
  spread(age, n)

# {papaja}

Despite having been around for  about 4 years 
[{papaja}](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) is still not on CRAN. 

More evidence that some of the best packages are not on CRAN.


--
Install with devtools

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")
```

---
# WIP

The package is seemingly perpetually under development. What does this mean?

--
* Re-install regularly.

--
* Not everything may work perfect - don't worry though, most things do

--
* You may want to peruse the current [issues](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues)
  + If you run into one (and you're sure it's an issue) consider opening one
  yourself
  + Bonus - the developer is very kind, so even if you open up a silly 
  issue, he's likely to be understanding

# YAML

# Modifications
* Obvious ones
  + title
  + author & author info
  + abstract
  + keywords

--
* Less obvious
  + `shorttitle` (running head)
  + `authornote` (can fully delete or modify)
  + `wordcount` (fairly useless at this point imo)
  + `bibliography` (we'll talk more about this momentarily)
  + `linenumbers`
  + floats 
  + mask (for blind peer-review)
  + `classoption`

---
# Let's play for a minute!
Modify some of the options on the previous slide. 

Specifically, try changing `classoption` from `man` to `jou`. Try other things
too.


---
# Add some LaTeX option

```
header-includes:
  - \raggedbottom
  - \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
```

This will help .gray[(save you lots of time googling)] remove the extra space
between paragraphs.

### From swcarpentry
![](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/play-changes.svg)

We can think of the changes as separate from the document

---
![](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/versions.svg)

This means there are many possible versions of the same document

---
![](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/merge.svg)

Unless there are conflicts, two changes from the same document can be merged
together

<!-- Show repo for NCME pres & talk about publishing -->

# How?
That's what we'll do today!

---
# Some basic terminology
* Version Control System
  + A tool to help us track changes. *git* is one such system (but there
    are others).
--
* Commit
  + Changes that have been made to the file(s)

--
* Repository (repo)
  + The files, full commit history, and associated metadata for a project

---
# Demo (30 minutes)
### Goal: Get your work from this morning in a GitHub repo!
* Create new repo
* Clone it locally
* Add your files
* Commit
* Push
* Publish

---
# Ignoring Files
* When we initialized the repo, we started it with a `.gitignore` file
* The `.gitignore` file tells the repo not to track certain files
  + e.g., proprietary data

# Citations

## Citations
To include references in your paper, you must:
* Create an external .bib file using LaTeX formatting (we'll get to this)
* Include `bibliography: nameOfYourBibFile.bib` in your YAML front matter.
* Refer to the citations in text using `@`

# In text citations

```{r inTextCitesTable, echo = FALSE}
style <- c("@Briggs11", "[see @Baldwin2014; @Caruso2000]", "[@Linn02, p. 9]", 
          "[-@Goldhaber08]")
out <- c("Briggs and Weeks (2011)", "(see Baldwin et al. 2014; Caruso 2000)",
         "(Linn and Haug 2002, 9)", "(2008)")
knitr::kable(data.frame(style, out), 
        col.names = c("Citation Style", "Output"),
        format = "html")
```

Note this is not APA. However, references are included automatically at the end of the document. Include `# References` as the last line of your document to give it a title.
