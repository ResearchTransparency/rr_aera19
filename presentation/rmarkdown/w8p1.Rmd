# Agenda 
* Introduce Distill (formerly (as in a few days ago) called Radix)
* Deployment


--
### Learning objectives
* Get at least a basic site deployed

---
# Announcements
* For this week's lab, we'll participate in [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday?src=hash)!
  + Note - I have no idea what the dataset will be

* Goal for lab
  + Play with unfamiliar data and produce something you're proud of
  + Should be highly collaborative


---
class: inverse center middle

# Distill
https://rstudio.github.io/distill/

---
# Disclaimer and assumptions
* This is a very basic (and probably fast) intro
  + Distill can do a lot that we won't get to

* I assume most of you have never created or deployed a website before
  + If you have, some of this might be slow but you can help others

* This "lecture" will be highly interactive

---
# Please follow along

```{r eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("radix")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/distill")
```

* Go to GitHub and create a repo to store your website (which you'll also use
for deployment)


---
# Back to RStudio
.red[Don't clone your repo yet!]

### Create new project
<img src="https://rstudio.github.io/distill/images/create-website.png"
height="300px"/>

---
# The steps
* Create a new RStudio Project 

* Select distill blog

* Use gitkraken (or command line if you're comfortable with that) to initiate a
repo locally and link it with your remote

* Commit/push

* Change GH settings for deployment

[demo]

---
# Author a new article
* `distill::create_post()`

* Create another one!


--
### Listings
Make sure your index file as

```
---
listing: posts
---
```

* Note that galleries are also possible

---
# Categories

* You make up the category names. Tag posts with those categories, and they will be linkable

```
---
categories:
  - dataviz
  - class
---
```

![](img/categories.png)

---
# Navigation

All controlled with `_site.yml`

* Let's add a github log that links to our repo


--
```
---
navbar:
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - icon: fa fa-github
      href: https://github.com/datalorax/class-site-example
---
```


---
# Create drop-down menus

```
---
navbar:
  left:
    - text: "Labs"
      menu:
        - text: "Getting Started with R"
          href: "lab1.html"
        - text: "Visualizing Distributions"
          href: "lab2.html"
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - icon: fa fa-github
      href: https://github.com/datalorax/class-site-example
---
```

---
# Base URL
Once your site is deployed (or you know the link it will be deployed to), change the `base_url` in the `_site.yml`

* Gives some nice sharing features (twitter cards)

* Allows you to use [citations](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/citations.html)

---
# Drafts
If you want to work on a post for a while without it being included in your website, use `draft = TRUE`

`distill::create_post("My new post", draft = TRUE)`


```
---
title: "My work on Lab 3"
description: |
  This lab was hard!
draft: true
---
```

---
# Figures

Change figure options with chunk options

* `layout = "l-body"` (default)
* `layout = "l-body-outset"`
* `layout = "l-page"`
* `layout = "l-screen"`
  + `layout = "l-screen-inset"`
  + `layout = "l-screen-inset shaded"`

### Let's go try!

---
# Additional figure options

* Rather than using `![]()`, you can use `knitr::include_graphics()` to have the same options.

* Use `fig.cap` in chunk options to give nice figure captions.

* Note these options should work for tables as well

---
# Side notes

```
<aside>
This is some text that will appear in the margin - similar to Tufte's style. It is often used to provide extra detail.
</aside>
```

--

You can also use this to show small plots

```
<aside>

ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Miles Per Gallon")

</aside>
```

---
# Customizing the theme

* Create a `style.css` file (or whatevs)

* Modify `_site.yml` to 

```
output:
  distill::distill_article:
    css: style.css
```

---
* Start with default CSS, and modify small elements

```
.distill-site-nav {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
  background-color: #455a64; 
  font-size: 15px;
  font-weight: 300;
}
```

becomes

```
.distill-site-nav {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
  background-color: #FF5FDD; 
  font-size: 15px;
  font-weight: 300;
}
```

---
# This can be fun!
Just be careful not to go too far

`r knitr::include_url("https://slides.yihui.name/2018-blogdown-rstudio-conf-Yihui-Xie.html#33")`

---
# Equations

Use latex notation and it should "just work"

`$$` `\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^n{x_i}` `$$`

becomes

.Large[
$$\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^n{x_i}$$
]

---
# Other features
* Table of Contents
* Appendices
* Citations
  + Both how to cite your article and bibliographies
