# Getting started
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("flexdashboard")
```

![](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/images/NewRMarkdown.png)


---
class: inverse middle center
# Do it
### knit right away
### Add some plots
### Play

---
# Columns

* Define new column with 

```
Column
----------------------------------
```

* Optionally specify the width with `{data-width}`

--
* Annoyingly, be careful with spacing! 

`{data-width=650}` will work

### but 

`{data-width = 650}` will not work


---
# New squares

```{md eval = FALSE}
### Square title
< r code chunk >
```

* Each time you add a square it will split the area evenly among all the squares

---
# Thinking in rows

* Change the YAML to 

```md
output: 
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    orientation: rows
```

--

* Each `###` will then create a new column


--
* Add new rows with

```md
Row
----------------------------------
```

--
* Modify height with `{data-height=XXX}`


---
# Pages
You can easily specify multiple pages by just specifying a Level 1 Header

```md
# Page 1

Column {data-width=650}
----------------------------
### Chart A
< r code>

Column {data-width=350}
----------------------------
### Chart B
< r code>

### Chart C
< r code>

# Page 2

```

---
# Sidebar
* Julia Silge's had a nice sidebar where she explained things about the flexdashboard... You can have this too!

```md
Sidebar Title {.sidebar}
--------

Your text here. You can use markdown syntax, including 
[links](http://blah.com), *italics*, **bolding**, etc.   
```


--
* Title seems to show up (for me) in mobile version but not


--
* Multiple pages? Just change the separator to keep it there

```md
Sidebar {.sidebar}
============

Your text here. You can use markdown syntax, including [links](http://blah.com), *italics*, **bolding**, etc.   
```


---
# Tabsets

This is actually a standard R Markdown feature, but you can use it with flexdashboards as well


```md
Column {.tabset}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chart 1
< r code>

### Chart 2
< r code>

### Data Table
< r code>
```

---
# Icons
* Probably not the most important thing, but fun

* Use Font awesome!

```md
# Years {data-icon="fa-calendar"}
```

---
# HTML Widgets

Add a touch of interactivity

* Plenty of HTML widgets for R out there (see https://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html)

* {plotly} is cool

```{r plotly, eval = FALSE}
library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

ggplotly(p) #<<
```

---
# Including Text

* If you want to include text about an overall figure, just put the text in the R Markdown doc like you normally would

```md
# Base {data-icon="fa-calendar"}
Here's a description about the plot that follows

### A base R plot
< r code>

```

---
# What if you have tabsets?

* Works great if you want to describe all the plots/tables/content in the tabset

* If you want to provide text for an individual plot, use `>`

```md

Column {.tabset data-width=350}
-------------------

This text will describe the full tabset

###  Chart 1
< r code>

> Here's some text for Chart 1

###  Table 1
< r code>

> Here's some text for Table 1

```

---
# Storyboarding

* A little bit advanced, but pretty cool

* First, change the YAML

```md
output: 
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    storyboard: true
```

---
```md
# Method {.storyboard}

### Sample Descriptives {data-commentary-width=400}
< r code>

**** 

This is some text describing what's going on with the sample, and how we moved from the raw data tot he analytic sample. 

### Correlation Matrix {data-commentary-width=200}
< r code>

****

There is less to say here so I made the commentary box smaller

# Results {.storyboard}

### Plot 1 {data-commentary-width=600}
< r code>

****

Lots to say here. There is important

### Plot 2 {data-commentary-width=200}

****

Move along

```

---
# Customization
* Add font-awesome stuff
* Change the [theme](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/using.html#appearance)

```md
flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
  theme: readable
```

---
# CSS
Consider creating some custom CSS (Rather complicated in this case)

Change the navigation bar to bright pink with thin blue border

```css
.navbar-inverse {
  background-color: #FE08A5;
  border-color: #0822FE;
}
```

Save the above code in "custom.css" then specify in the YAML

```md
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    css: custom.css
```

Making sure "custom.css" is in the same directory as your flexdashboard Rmd.


---
# Add a logo and favicon

```md
output: 
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    logo: logo.png
    favicon: favicon.png
```

# Slides (briefly)

# xaringan

### /ʃæ.'riŋ.ɡæn/

---
# Install
* I'd recommend going with the GitHub version

```{r install-xaringan-gh, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("yihui/xaringan")
```

* If you're more comfortable using fully stable software, install from CRAN

```{r install-xaringan-cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("xaringan")
```

---
# What it is

.pull-left[
* HTML-based slides
* Produced with R Markdown
* Styled with CSS
]

.pull-right[

]


---
# Themes
This is the `uo` theme
See All the available themes with `xaringan:::list_css()`

```{r list_css}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---
# Specify a theme

## How do you create your own theme?

<br/>
### My advice
1. Start with an existing theme
1. Modify the CSS 
  + Change .large[.bolder[.red[c].blue[o].green[l].yellow[o].purple[r].orange[s]]]!
  + Change fonts! (see [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Changing-fonts), 
  import fonts with [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com))
  + Consider changes to the background
1. Once you've found the parts you want to modify, copy them into a new CSS file, and reference it from your YAML


---
```

title: "Presentation Ninja"
subtitle: "⚔<br/>with xaringan"
author: "Yihui Xie"
date: "2016/12/12"

  xaringan::moon_reader:

    lib_dir: libs
    nature:
      highlightStyle: github
      highlightLines: true
      countIncrementalSlides: false
---
```


---
# Look at CSS for [existing themes](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources)

![](img/existing-themes.png)

---
# Basically this

.center[<img src = "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/33/fb/06/33fb067593a2a949e349a4e899c508d3--programming-humor-o-reilly.jpg",
 height = 480 />]


---
# Some basic features
* separate slides with `---`

* Get incremental appearance of items on the slide with `--`

* Separate into two-panel format with `pull-left[]` and `pull-right[]`

* Titles with Level 1 header

* Specify class of slides with `class`


---
```md
<YAML>

# Title slide 1

Here's some text

< r code >

.pull-left[
This part will be in the left panel
]

.pull-right[
this part will be in the right panel
]

--

This will be back to the default format, and appear on click

# Slide 2

+ New slide with a bullet in inverse, center, middle format

```

---
class: inverse middle
background-image: url(https://images.pexels.com/photos/257840/pexels-photo-257840.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260)
background-size: cover

# Background images

---
Code for previous slide looked like this

```md
class: inverse middle
background-image: url(https://images.pexels.com/photos/257840/pexels-photo-257840.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260)
background-size: cover
```

---
# Publish

Lots of options, but GitHub pages works great
* Create a repo on GitHub with everything for your slides

  + CSS files, image files, etc. (it all needs to be in there)

* Make your HTML file named `index.html`

* Change the GitHub pages setting to publish the master branch

---
# [slidex](https://github.com/datalorax/slidex)

https://github.com/datalorax/slidex

Transition PowerPoint slides to xaringan slides
* Currently exports one function: 

```{r slidex, eval = FALSE}
convert_pptx("path/to/pptx", author = "Your Name")
```

--

* Still a WIP - not perfect but can do a lot
  + Maintains bulleting (basically)
  + Maintains and reproduces tables 
  + Maintains images
  + Maintains links
  + Easy selection of existing themes (additional `theme` argument).
