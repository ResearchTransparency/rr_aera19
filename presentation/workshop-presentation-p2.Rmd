### From swcarpentry
![](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/play-changes.svg)

We can think of the changes as separate from the document

---
![](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/versions.svg)

This means there are many possible versions of the same document

---
![](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/fig/merge.svg)

Unless there are conflicts, two changes from the same document can be merged
together

<!-- Show repo for NCME pres & talk about publishing -->

# How?
That's what we'll do today!

---
# Some basic terminology
* Version Control System
  + A tool to help us track changes. *git* is one such system.

--
* Commit
  + Changes that have been made to the file(s)

--
* Repository (repo)
  + Entire project (including history)

--
* Clone
  + Download files locally

--
* Pull
  + Get latest changes

--
* Push
  + Send latest commits to remote repo

---
# Demo (30 minutes)
### Goal: Get your work from this morning in a GitHub repo!
* Create new repo
* Clone it locally
* Add your files
* Commit
* Push
* Publish

---

# .gitignore


---
# Ignoring Files
* When we initialized the repo, we started it with a `.gitignore` file
* The `.gitignore` file tells the repo not to track certain files
  + e.g., proprietary data

## Citations
To include references in your paper, you must:
* Create an external .bib file using LaTeX formatting (we'll get to this)
* Include `bibliography: nameOfYourBibFile.bib` in your YAML front matter.
* Refer to the citations in text using `@`

# In text citations

```{r inTextCitesTable, echo = FALSE}
style <- c("@Briggs11", "[see @Baldwin2014; @Caruso2000]", "[@Linn02, p. 9]", 
          "[-@Goldhaber08]")
out <- c("Briggs and Weeks (2011)", "(see Baldwin et al. 2014; Caruso 2000)",
         "(Linn and Haug 2002, 9)", "(2008)")
knitr::kable(data.frame(style, out), 
        col.names = c("Citation Style", "Output"),
        format = "html")
```

Note this is not APA. However, references are included automatically at the end of the document. Include `# References` as the last line of your document to give it a title.
