The proposal narrative should address the following (3-pages single spaced limit):

## Prerequisite skills or knowledge needed for course participation

## Target course participants

Indicate what level of knowledge (e.g., basic, intermediate,
advanced) the target audience (e.g., graduate students, emerging researchers, continuing researchers) must have in order to participate fully in the course. Also, indicate the number of course participants you can accommodate.

## Rationale

Provide a rationale for this course. Why is this course important to education research and those who work in the field?

Recent research on open science in general (Bertling  Friesike, 2014) and in educational research (van der Zee & Reich, 2018) and about replication in particular (Gehlbach & Robinson, 2017). Research about building knowledge in the field, related to replication (Hedges, 2018).

Recent research about preparing educational researchers and advancing the methodological capabilities of the field (Henson, Hull, & Williams, 2010)

Recent calls for registered reports ([AERA Open](http://journals.sagepub.com/page/ero/collections/special-topic-collections/index), [Journal of Computer Assisted Learning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13652729)).

Societies emphasizing open science ([Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](https://www.improvingpsych.org), [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/))

## Learning objectives

List and clearly define the learning objectives and purpose(s) of the course.

## Course content

Describe the topics and issues that the course examines. This should include a description of the course structure (i.e., lecture, small group interactions, hands-on demonstrations), overview of the course, discussion of the course focus, and an overview of the planned activities.
