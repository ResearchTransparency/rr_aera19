advanced) the target audience (e.g., graduate students, emerging researchers, continuing researchers) must have in order to participate fully in the course. Also, indicate the number of course participants you can accommodate.
* Rationale – Provide a rationale for this course. Why is this course important to education research and those who work in the field?
* Learning objectives – List and clearly define the learning objectives and purpose(s) of the course.
* Course content – Describe the topics and issues that the course examines. This should include a description of the course structure (i.e., lecture, small group interactions, hands-on demonstrations), overview of the course, discussion of the course focus, and an overview of the planned activities.
