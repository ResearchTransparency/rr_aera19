# Proposal narrative: AERA Professional Development Proposal

The purpose of this proposal is to provide participants with an introduction to
tools for open, transparent, and reproducible analysis workflows. Specifically,
we discuss R Markdown for integrating text with code and *GitHub* for
collaboration and documentation of the project history.

## Prerequisite skills or knowledge needed for course participation

All participants should  have an interest in conducting open and
transparent analyses. This training will be most useful to those with 
experience planning, carrying out, and writing up the results of a research
project. We will specifically discuss moving from existing frameworks to
reproducible frameworks using R and R Markdown.

All participants should also have at least a basic familiarity with R and be
comfortable with the idea of working in a coding environment. Note that the
presenters have partnered with Datacamp (https://www.datacamp.com) to help
provide a platform for less experienced users to get "up to speed" prior to the
training. Datacamp is an online learning platform for R (and related data
science technologies) that includes direct instruction and opportunities to
practice and apply the learned skills, all within an online platform. All
participants will have access to the full suite of Datacamp modules for one
month prior to, and one month following, our in-person training. 

Users with less experience with R will be asked to complete
the 
[Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r), 
[Working with the RStudio IDE: Part 1](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1), and 
[Introduction to the *tidyverse*](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) 
modules prior to the training. Following the training, we recommend all
participants re-visit the skills they have learned by completing the 
[Reporting with R Markdown](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown) module.

## Target course participants

<!-- Indicate what level of knowledge (e.g., basic, intermediate, advanced) the target audience (e.g., graduate students, emerging researchers, continuing researchers) must have in order to participate fully in the course. Also, indicate the number of course participants you can accommodate. -->

Target audience includes graduate students, emerging or early-career
researchers, and continuing researchers interested in their own or their
students'/trainees' work becoming more open, transparent, and reproducible.
Because both an overview of ideas related to reproducibility as well as a
number of quantitative and computational tools and approaches will be 
described, participants with less experience can benefit from developing a more
conceptual understanding of open science; they can turn to the tools later on.
This training is aimed at beginners who have little to no experience using R
Markdown or version control with *git*/*GitHub*, but who feel comfortable
learning code and at least a basic understanding of R.

## Rationale

<!-- Provide a rationale for this course. Why is this course important to education research and those who work in the field? -->

The basic premise of reproducible research is that quantitative analyses should
be conducted and documented with sufficient clarity that independent 
researchers could reproduce all the results, exactly. Initially, this may 
sound relatively straightforward---of course research findings should be
reproducible---and we may like to think the most research in education adheres
to these principles. Unfortunately, this is generally not the case. For
example, in a large-scale review of growth models published from 2007-2012
across 47 education and psychology journals, Stevens, Nese, and Tindal (2013)
found that documenting even relatively routine procedures, such as how much
missing data were involved and how the missing data were handled, was
extraordinarily difficult. Indeed, in the vast majority of cases, this
information was simply missing. These findings were likely the result of, at
least in part, researchers attempting to summarize their study without getting
bogged down in the details. The findings, however, are congruent with
@buckheit95, who argue "an article about computational science in a
scientific publication is **not** the scholarship itself, it is merely the
**advertising** of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete
software development environment and the complete set of instructions which
generated the figures" (p. 5, emphasis in the original). This may seem a
somewhat extreme view, but it clearly articulates that a journal article on its
own is generally insufficient for the accumulation of scientific evidence. That
is, it is difficult to build off the work of others, or verify study results, 
if you only have access to the published findings. It is important to note as
well that reproducibility to not imply "correctness", but rather transparency
in process. Indeed, part of the reason reproducible research is so important is
that it allows other researchers a means to verify the process, analysis, and
ultimately the validity of study findings.

### Conducting reproducible research
Considerable recent attention has been paid to open and reproducible
research in science generally [@bartling14; @na18], but also in
educational research [@cook18; @mcbee17; @van18]. What is often lacking,
however, is a clear description and tutorial on how to actually begin
engaging in open and reproducible research. This training seeks to fill that 
gap by providing an initial introduction to tools to help make the process more
tractable. In particular, we advocate for *conducting science publicly* through
the publication of living code that is modified and updated as the project
matures, along with *literate programming* a concept introduced by @knuth84 
that weaves substantive text from the manuscript with analysis code. Although
literate programming has its own learning curve, leading to an initial dip in
productivity, it can eventually lead to massive gains in efficiency by all
tables, figures, and in-text references to statistics (e.g., sample means)
updated automatically each time the document is rendered. There is therefore no
hand entering of model results into tables, which can be error prone, and any 
tweaks to the model or data (including new data be added to the research)
results in the entire document being updated automatically. The manuscript is
therefore *dynamic* relative to the analysis [@xie16]. This process may 
sound complicated to implement, and it was even a few short years ago. Yet, the
toolkit for producing dynamic, reproducible documents is rapidly expanding
and is now far more accessible for the applied researcher. When this process is
paired with a version control system such as *git*, and made publicly available
through platforms such as *GitHub*, the project and process is far more open 
and transparent. Importantly, however, our training also discusses how to make
specific parts of the project (e.g., the raw data) *not* available publicly to
ensure research participant privacy.

*Note*. This is copied from the description.

This training concerns reproducibility in educational research. Reproducibility is an important consideration for doing research that contributes to theory and builds our understanding of educational practice. While reproducibility has been the focus of other disciplines, where infrastructure and support for it are being developed, educational research has been somewhat slow to embrace reproducible research. The purpose of this workshop is to provide an overview of reproducibility (and ideas related to open science) and to introduce participants to tools that make doing reproducible work possible and efficient. In particular, we emphasize tools from the R software environment, which has multiple tools which work together (in conjunction with a supportive community) to support reproducibility, from the first stages of a data analysis and project to the last. -->

## Learning objectives

*List and clearly define the learning objectives and purpose(s) of the course.*

* Understand why reproducibility is an increasingly important consideration for educational researchers
* Know about some of the efforts to make reproducible research more feasible and better supported within and outside of educational research
* Learn about tools, particularly those related to the R software environment, for carrying out and distributing reproducible research
* Build a network of others interested in reproducible research through involvement in a mailing list (not sure this is remotely a good idea :))

## Course content

*Describe the topics and issues that the course examines. This should include a description of the course structure (i.e., lecture, small group interactions, hands-on demonstrations), overview of the course, discussion of the course focus, and an overview of the planned activities.*
